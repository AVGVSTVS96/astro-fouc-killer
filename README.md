# astro-fouc-killer

This is an [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) that sets the dark mode class on the root element of the page based on the local storage value or system preference, if no value is set in local storage.

This package is structured as a monorepo:

- [`playground`](./playground) contains code for testing the package
- [`package`](./package) contains the actual package

To see how to get started, check out the [package README](./package/README.md)
