# Astro FOUC Killer Test Playground

![just-the-basics](https://github.com/withastro/astro/assets/2244813/a0a5533c-a856-4198-8470-2d67b1d7c554)

## Testing `astro-fouc-killer`
Testing the package is simple:

 1. `pnpm run dev` from the playground directory or `pnpm playground:dev` from the root directory
 2. Open the browser at `http://localhost:4321`
 3. Set prefers-color-scheme to dark and see if the background is changes when the page reloads and ensure there is no FOUC when reloading
 4. Create a local storage item with the key `theme-test` and set it to `dark`. See if the background changes immediately when the `includeStorageListener` option is `true`, or when refreshing the page when it's `false`
 5. Change the `localStorageKey` option in `astro.config.mts` and see if it still works, try testing with the default value of `themeToggle`

> [!TIP]
> `astro-fouc-killer` will log to the console which scripts were injected. When `includeStorageListener` is set to `true` (default), the local storage listener will also be injected, otherwise it will be omitted and only the FOUC killer script will be injected.
